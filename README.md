# NvChad Custom Config

This repo contains my custom config for [NvChad](https://nvchad.com). It's still a work in progress while I learn how to properly customise NvChad. I'm sharing it because I couldn't find many example repos while learning NvChad.

## Installation

1. Install [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install)

2. Copy the contents of this repo to `~/.config/nvim/lua/custom/`
